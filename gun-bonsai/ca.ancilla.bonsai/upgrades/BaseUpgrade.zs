// Base class for weapon and player upgrades.
// To implement a Gun Bonsai upgrade in your own mod:
// - Subclass TFLV_Upgrade_BaseUpgrade
// - Implement at least one of the IsSuitableFor* functions with the conditions
//   needed for the upgrade to spawn
// - Implement at least one of the On* or Modify* functions with the actual
//   effects of the upgrade
// - If your effect should be triggerable by other effects, set an appropriate
//   priority level in Priority()
// - Add the name and description to your LANGUAGE file; the keys should be
//   [upgrade_class_name]_Name and [upgrade_class_name]_Desc, e.g.
//   TFLV_Upgrade_Pyre_Name and TFLV_Upgrade_Pyre_Desc.
// - Optionally, add a tooltip with more details, in [upgrade_class_name]_TT; if
//   you want to add dynamic details, put @field-name markers in the tooltip and
//   populate them in GetTooltipFields() in your upgrade.
// - Add a BONSAIRC lump to your mod with a Register directive for your upgrade(s).
// - All done! The upgrade should now start appearing in play when your mod is
//   loaded after Gun Bonsai.

// Upgrade priority levels. Higher priorities can trigger lower priorities,
// but not vice versa.
// So (e.g.) the fragments from Fragmentation Shots (PRI_FRAGMENTATION) can
// proc poison effects (PRI_ELEMENTAL), but the poison DoT won't cause the
// afflicted enemy to start emitting fragments.
// As a special case, attacks with no defined priority (PRI_MISSING) can trigger
// anything -- this is the "priority" associated with attacks not governed by
// Gun Bonsai.
// It is currently stored in the `weaponspecial` field, on the assumption that
// this is not used for anything on projectiles.
// Possible other places if that turns out to be unsuitable:
// - movecount (used by monsters)
// - accuracy, stamina, health, or reactiontime
// - score

  // Tick function. Equivalent to Thinker.Tick() but we define it here because
  // we can't inherit from Thinker and have the upgrades survive level changes.
  virtual void Tick(Actor owner) {}

  // Priority system.
  // The basic idea here is that upgrade effects can only be triggered by (a)
  // events not associated with an upgrade, like normal player attacks, and (b)
  // events associated with a higher-priority upgrade.
  // So, for example, Explosive Shots (PRI_EXPLOSIVE) can proc Poison Shots
  // (PRI_ELEMENTAL), but the poison dot can't trigger the Explosive Shots.
  // Default is lowest priority -- can be triggered by anything, can't trigger
  // anything.
  // In order for this to work right, secondary actors created by upgrade effects
  // need to have their `master` pointer set to the upgrade object that created
  // them.
  // Generally speaking, any upgrade that can be triggered by OnDamage effects
  // should set this to higher than PRI_ELEMENTAL unless it makes sense for it
  // to be triggered by elemental dots, and any upgrade that spawns secondary
  // actors should also set it to higher than PRI_ELEMENTAl so that those actors
  // can proc elemental riders.
  // As a special case, upgrades with PRI_NULL can neither trigger nor be triggered
  // by other upgrades.
  // CheckPriority is marked virtual so that upgrades doing weird things can
  // override it to perform more complicated checking logic; see the
  // ElementalBeam upgrade for an example of this.

# 0.10.0

- Balance:
  - Submunitions have been heavily reworked:
    - Number of submunitions reduced
    - Damage scales with target HP but is split across all munitions
    - Submunition spawning and despawning is smeared across multiple tics
    - Enemies take full damage from submunitions if they are anywhere in the blast radius

# 0.9.7

- New:
  - Gun Bonsai logs its release version and git commit ID to the console on startup.
- Fix:
  - Rapid Fire now works properly with Doom Nukem, and probably a lot of other mods where it didn't work right before.
  - libtooltipmenu is now integrated. This fixes compatibility with other mods that have improperly copied libttm into their pk3.
  - Upgrade tooltips no longer show a diff against a theoretical level 0 upgrade when choosing them for the first time.
  - The Thorns tooltip no longer causes a division by 0 crash on some builds of gzDoom.
- Change:
  - Thunderbolt now uses a sprite effect rather than a huge number of particle effects when it triggers.

# 0.9.6

- New:
  - Upgrades can now declare tooltips that will display in the status and level-up menus for additional detail.
  - Tooltips added for most upgrades, showing specific numbers for their effects and previewing the effects of level-ups.
  - As a debugging tool, you can set `bonsai_upgrade_choices_per_player_level` and `bonsai_gun_choices_per_player_level` to -1 to list all upgrades. This will produce upgrade choices that do not work, so it is mostly useful for testing menu display code.
- Balance:
  - Swiftness now goes into slow-mo for the last 0.5s of its duration rather than the last 3.5s, meaning it does actually stop time even at low levels.
  - Piercing Shots now applies a damage penalty. Taking more levels mitigates the penalty
- Fix:
  - Heretic's wand and staff are now considered "wimpy" weapons.
  - Some errors in `UPGRADES.md` about what upgrades were available on what weapons corrected.
  - Shield now properly stacks infinitely, albeit with diminishing returns.
  - Scavenge Lead spawns now respect actor replacement rules.
  - Dark Harvest now respects permanent health upgrades when calculating the cap.
  - Burning Terror now gives +1 dps per level, rather than +5 dps every five levels.

# 0.9.5

- New:
  - Multiplayer support! There may still be some issues but hopefully they should be more on the "weird glitch" side than the "desyncs/breaks" side.
  - Thank you Dan_The_Noob in particular for testing MP!
- Fix:
  - Crash when Thunderbolt triggers on an enemy as it's killed when certain mods are installed.

# 0.9.4

- New:
  - "Ammoless weapons are wimpy" setting; turn this off for Hideous Destructor
  - HUD opacity setting
  - Complete Brazilian Portugese translation for options screen
- Balance:
  - Thunderbolt is now a bit easier to trigger, and gets easier as you add more levels
  - Rapid Fire now increases attack speed by 50%
  - Rapid Fire now caps at 10 (6x IAS) rather than 1 (2x)
  - Rapid Fire is available only on weapons that use ammo, to prevent it from being strictly better than Damage+ on weapons without
- Fix:
  - Improved Hideous Destructor compatibility (thanks to Ted the Dragon)
  - Internal cleanup of how cvars are accessed
  - Revivified enemies no longer have their `master` set to the player, so enemies with (e.g.) `KillMaster` scripts won't vaporize the player when revived
  - Elemental Synthesis upgrades copy all properties, not just the base level, of elemental effects
  - OnActivate effects like rapid fire now persist properly across level transitions

# 0.9.3

- New:
  - `WIMPY` weapon type support in BONSAIRC
  - full `LANGUAGE` support for the options menu, all of Gun Bonsai can now be translated!
- Balance:
  - XP cost reductions for Wimpy and Melee weapons no longer stack; weapons that are both will have whichever is lower of the two costs
  - (experimental) Weapons that do not use ammo are considered Wimpy
  - (experimental) Some previously melee-only upgrades -- Shield, Dark Harvest, and Swiftness -- are now also available on wimpy weapons
- Fix:
  - Melee weapon detection reverted to its pre-0.9 behaviour of trusting the +MELEEWEAPON flag, since the more complicated approaches caused more problems than they solved
  - LegenDoom bonus effects are now earned at the correct levels
  - LZDoom compatibility restored
  - Tentative fix for XP overflow issues some users have reported
  - Crash in WorldThingSpawned if the thing spawned stops existing before the event handler is called; this doesn't happen in normal play but some mods can cause it

# 0.9.2 hotfix

- Change:
  - Updates to Brazilian Portugese translation
- Fix:
  - Crash on TITLEMAP and some other situations where the PlayerPawn exists but has no weapon equipped
  - Debug messages were left enabled in the release build
  - Missing description and name for Intuition upgrade

# 0.9.2

- New:
  - Intuition player upgrade reveals map geometry and actor locations
  - Rapid Fire weapon upgrade doubles firing speed
  - LANGUAGE lump support:
    - gameplay log/printf messages (except for debug messages)
    - level-up and status displays
    - menu titles and enum names (full support for options menu coming next version)
  - partial Brazilian Portugese translation by Generic Name Guy
- Balance:
  - Revivified enemies will now die after a few seconds out of combat, hopefully fixing "I revived something and now it won't die and the level scripting is broken" issues
  - Revivification triggers more often to make up for the fact that enemies can no longer be kept as pets for the entire level
- Change:
  - Fast Shots renamed High Velocity to address confusion about whether it affects shot travel speed or rate of fire
  - upgrade appendix moved into [its own file](./UPGRADES.md)
  - OnActivate/OnDeactivate API enabling new kinds of upgrades to be written
  - melee weapon detection should be more permissive now
  - builtin upgrades are now registered via BONSAIRC lump
- Fix:
  - crash when opening the menu while no weapon is equipped

# 0.9.1

- New: number of upgrades you can choose from on level up is configurable
  - Player and weapon counts can be configured separately
  - A setting of 1 will randomly choose an upgrade for you as soon as you gain a level
  - A setting of 0 will let you choose from the complete list of available upgrades
- New: improved weapon type inference code
  - detects melee weapons based on average engagement range rather than trusting the (often missing or misused) `+MELEEWEAPON` flag
  - detects FastProjectile weapons and weapons firing seeking, bouncing, and ripping projectiles
  - these types can also be set manually in the BONSAIRC lump
  - upgrade selection will avoid spawning upgrades that don't work (e.g. Homing on a FastProjectile weapon) or are redundant (e.g. Piercing on a weapon that fires ripper shots)
- New: `bonsai-level-up` netevent is emitted when you gain enough XP to level up (before you open the menu and choose an upgrade)
- New: emitted netevents are now documented in [MODDING.md](./MODDING.md)
- Change: "base level cost" menu item is now a textfield
- Change: the player levelup menu will no longer open automatically on levelup
- Change: `bonsai_show_info_console` replaced with `bonsai-dump`, which is an alias for `netevent bonsai-debug,info`.
- Change: `bonsai_choose_level_up_option` netevent renamed `bonsai-choose-level-up-option`. The old netevent is still emitted for backwards compatibility with AutoAutoSave but will be removed in 0.10.x.
- Change: a number of other netevents were renamed but as far as I know no-one else was using them for anything, so they don't get compatibility shims
- Balance: Damage (weapon) is now +20%/+1 rather than +25%/+2
- Balance: Shield is now 20% and stacks up to a max of 60%, rather than 50% -> 75%
- Balance: Shield cannot reduce incoming damage below 1
- Fix: HUD should now render overtop of other HUD elements
- Fix: Hexen cleric mace & Strife punch dagger are now considered melee weapons
- Fix: BONSAIRC now reports when it's enabling conditional configurations, and which ones
- Fix: BONSAIRC now produces a single error and stops parsing when encountering a malformed type, enable, or disable command
- Fix: Lightning will *probably* no longer permanently paralyze enemies, or (in some mods) make them immortal
- Fix: Homing Shots now properly sets the `+SEEKERMISSILE` flag on projectiles
- Fix: the levelup flash/sound settings are now respected for player levelups
- Fix: crash when subjected to an instadeath (e.g. bottomless pit) that kills `PlayerInfo` but leaves `PlayerPawn` intact
- Fix: crash when the player's inventory is taken away (fixes Blade of Agony)

# 0.9.0

**This release breaks save compatibility.**

- New: BONSAIRC chunk support (see `MODDING.md` for details)
  - Text chunk that contains rules for configuring Gun Bonsai based on what mods are loaded
  - Selectively enable or disable upgrades globally
  - Override Bonsai's weapon type detection for individual weapons
  - Disable individual upgrades on a per-weapon basis, or disable all upgrades for a weapon
  - Mark certain weapons as equivalent to each other and thus capable of sharing upgrades (e.g. a base weapon and its upgraded form)
- New: upgrades can be carried from weapons to their upgraded forms
  - The weapon and its upgrade(s) must be marked as merged in a BONSAIRC lump
  - The old weapon must be removed and the new weapon added in the same game tic if using "upgrades bind to individual weapons"
- New: `bonsai-debug,reset` debug command
- New: upgrades are now kept across death-exits and pistol starts

- New: upgrades can be selectively toggled on and off from the info menu
- Fix: Weapons retain their upgrades when empowered by the Tome of Power
- Fix: rejecting a player level-up now refunds half the cost of that level, rounded up
- Fix: A number of general compatibility fixes that especially benefit Hexen; many projectile weapon upgrades now function that didn't before
- Game-specific fixes:
  - Hexen: several weapons had upgrades that do not work on them, or which duplicate effects already built into the weapon, disabled
    - some of these will eventually turn into general fixes but for now they are a Hexen-specific tweak
  - Hellrider: Juggler will no longer be offered as an upgrade
  - Hideous Destructor: non-weapons like the clip manager no longer earn XP and level up
  - Ashes Afterglow: sawn-off now gets hitscan upgrades instead of melee
  - Ashes Afterglow: upgrading a weapon keeps the upgrades on it

# 0.8.6 hotfix

- Fix: crash on startup when using -warp, +load, or other commands that bypass the main menu

# 0.8.6

- Change: HUD scale is now always set as a fraction of screen size rather than a size in pixels
- Change: HUD text layout adjusted, now shows level and XP for both player and weapon
- Change: lightning now freezes enemies into their current state rather than their pain state
- Balance: Burning Terror no longer triggers pain, but recovery from fear takes longer.
- Balance: Piercing Shots now requires two levels of Fast Shots
- Balance: Piercing Shots is now mutually exclusive with Bouncy Shots and Fragmentation Shots
- Fix: HUD text now scales properly with screen size and HUD size
- Fix: Fire and Lightning effects no longer make Hexen Centaurs immortal
- Fix: Bouncy Shots no longer makes things worse when taken on an already-bouncy weapon (making it not appear on those weapons at all will be fixed in a future version)
- Fix: Bouncy Shots no longer slow down when hitting a wall

# 0.8.5

- Balance: Fire now burns slightly less aggressively
- Balance: Burning Terror triggers more easily but enemies will eventually recover from it
- Fix: remove stray VFX from Swiftness that were left in there from debugging
- Fix: Infernal Kiln and Conflagration should now actually be available in the upgrade pool

# 0.8.4

- Balance: Swiftness now grants 35 tics (+7 per additional level) per kill
- Balance: Swiftness cap is now the same as the initial grant, and increases by 5 tics per kill during a swiftness combo
- Balance: Submunitions no longer trigger more Submunitions on kill
- Fix: music and sound effects no longer stop when Swiftness triggers
- Fix: crash when using `bonsai-debug,w-up` incorrectly

- Fix: HP/AC caps for Scavenge and Dark Harvest are now based on the player's max health FOR REAL THIS TIME

# 0.8.3

- Balance: Thorns only procs elemental effects on nearby enemies.
- Change: README compatibility/known issues sections reworked some; compat note for Hellrider
- Fix: crash when dying with the Juggler upgrade
- Fix: attacking friendlies no longer awards XP or procs upgrade effects
- Fix: HP/AC caps for Scavenge and Dark Harvest are now based on the player's max health rather than on a hardcoded value of 100.
- Fix: crash when using debug commands to add an upgrade that doesn't exist

# 0.8.2

- New: health/armour drops cast light.
- New: WIP LZDoom compatibility. Some menus have rendering problems but it is playable.
- New: compatibility note about Final Doomer.
- New: FAQ entry about the HUD being covered up by other UI elements.
- New: options to disable the level-up flash and sound effect
- New: alternate HUD skins selectable from the options, thanks to Craneo
- Change: default HUD position changed to top right to make it less likely to be covered by other HUDs by default.
- Balance: Poison Shots no longer depends on a puff. This makes it consistent with the other elemental upgrades. This means that (like the other such upgrades) it can trigger in a variety of situations that might not make sense, so this behaviour might be revised in a future version.
- Balance: HE Rounds damage bonus reduced from 40%/0 (what was I thinking?) to 10%/1. It's now an actual choice between the Damage upgrade for pure damage output or HE Rounds for area of effect.
- Balance: HE Rounds damage falls off more gradually.
- Balance: Dark Harvest now restores a flat 1/1 hp/ac per level, x10 for bosses, capped at 100 + 20/level.
- Balance: Scavenge Blood restores a flat 1 hp, with a cap of 100 at level 1 and 200 at level 2+

- Fix: intermitten crash when Homing Projectiles impact something.
- Fix: crash when enemies are erased after Chain Lightning starts arcing to them but before it finishes.

# 0.8.0

**Note:** Renamed to Gun Bonsai (from Laevis) for general release.

- New: fancy graphics for HP/AP bonuses from <willibab.itch.io>
- New: the level-up menu opens next time you open the weapon info screen, rather than immediately
- New: rejecting a level-up with ESC still costs XP but does not level-up the weapon (and thus increase the XP cost for the next level)
- New: rejecting a player level-up now refunds half the cost of the level
- New: HUD gets all fancy when it's level-up time
- New: Indestructable upgrade integrates with the mod of the same name

- Fix: trying to cycle Legendoom weapon effects when wielding a weapon with no effects crashed the game
- Fix: setting "gun levels per LD effect" to 0 would crash the game next time you leveled up
- Fix: earning large amounts of XP at once made it possible to take otherwise impossible combinations of upgrades

# 0.7.4

- New: README contains information about discovered incompatibilities with Hideous Destructor
- Balance: Fire tree rework
  - Fire damage rate increased

  - Conflagration ignition radius significantly increased, and scales with actor size
  - Conflagration still procs even once the enemy is no longer burning
  - new intermediate upgrade: Burning Terror causes enemies to flee and flinch while burning
- Fix: XP wasn't gained for damage-over-time effects
- Fix: XP gained didn't properly correspond to damage in some circumstances
- Fix: Explosive Shots could crash in some circumstances
- Fix: overkilling an enemy could result in negative XP

# 0.7.3

- New: XP-from-damage and XP-from-score can both be turned on the same time, with independent multipliers
- New: Fragmentation Shots are now fast-moving projectiles rather than hitscans
- Balance: remove Agonizer from the melee upgrade pool, as it's redundant with Shock
- Balance: Revivified enemies only take 1 damage from the player
- Balance: Fragmentation Shots now pass through the enemy you hit, hitting everything around it
- Balance: Fragmentation Shots no longer self-damage
- Fix: Scavenge Blood and Scavenge Steel will always grant at least 1 health/armour per kill
- Fix: Scavenge items no longer count towards the level item count
- Fix: Revivified minions no longer count towards the level monster count
- Fix: Revivified minions didn't apply vs. player damage modifiers properly
- Fix: certain types of instakill (e.g. in TNT MAP30) could cause crashes

- Fix: remove Beam from the README, as it's an unfinished upgrade that you can't actually unlock
- Fix: Scavenge Lead would start giving you ammo from other games if you found a backpack
- Fix: hitscan/projectile inference was just completely broken all the time
- Fix: very fast projectiles are now counted as hitscans for e.g. Hideous Destructor
- Fix: upgrades with on-tick effects for the player, such as Infernal Kiln, did not trigger when not using a scoremod
- Fix: the XP scaling setting for scoremods didn't work
- Fix: it is now possible to earn fractional XP rather than rounding down to 0
- Fix: Fragmentation Shots now properly trigger elemental effects

# 0.7.2

- Fix: Explosive Death now actually works, with a blast radius based on the size of the dead thing
- Fix: Submunitions could crash on enemy death

# 0.7.1

- Fix: crash in OnDamageDealt when attacks lacked an inflictor
- Fix: OnDamageDealt didn't properly trigger for some attacks

# 0.7.0

- New: Lightning tree
  - Shocking Inscription paralyzes enemies on hit
  - Revivification brings back slain enemies to serve you
  - Chain Lightning electrocutes entire rooms
  - Thunderbolt smites your target after repeated attacks

- New: Submunitions, causing enemies to release explosives when killed.
- New: Scavenge Lead, which causes enemies to drop ammo when killed.
- Change: Life Leech and Armour Leech replaced with Scavenge Blood and Scavenge Steel
  - Rather than restoring on attack, enemies drop restorative items.
- Change: softcap mechanic for elemental effects
  - Elemental stacks no longer have a hard cap, but suffer rapidly diminishing
    returns once they go above the soft cap
  - Some effects are linked to exceeding the cap, e.g. Thunderbolt triggers when
    you have twice as many stacks as the softcap on the target
- Change: Acid Spray sprays less acid, but applies it to all enemies in range
  rather than being able to "run out" of acid.
- Fix: acid applied by Acid Spray inherits the Concentrated Acid level of the
  original acid effect.
- Fix: learning Acid Spray now properly counts as mastering the Acid element
- Fix: damage dealt by DoTs should be less confusing to the "is it a hitscan or
  a projectile weapon" code, hopefully fixing the issue where (e.g.) the rocket
  launcher is misidentified as a hitscan weapon

# 0.6.5

- Change: renamed "Shots" to "Inscription" in elemental upgrades so the names make
  sense with (e.g.) melee weapons.
- Change: Explosive Death now has a brief delay before dealing explosive damage, so
  explosions visibily ripple outwards when a chain reaction is triggered.
- Change: Explosive Death's range now increases more slowly with levels, and is
  based on the radius of the exploding monster; bigger enemies produce bigger booms.
- Change: split the menu code into a separate library, libtooltipmenu.pk3
- Change: you can now pick between 4 upgrades when you gain a level
- Fix: upgrade generation can no longer take unbounded time if you're unlucky
- Fix: upgrade generation can no longer freeze the game if the pool of upgrade candidates is very small
- Fix: Added some missing sprites to the repo (they were still in the pk3 but not versioned)

# 0.6.4

- Change: elemental upgrade prerequisites are now relaxed; basic and intermediate
  upgrades need to be level 2 to unlock the next tier, but higher-tier upgrades
  can now be leveled up to match the tier below.
- Change: WeaponInfo objects can now be rebound to arbitrary weapons even of
  different classes; this has no user-facing effect but may be useful for mod
  integrations.
- Change: internal cleanup of Legendoom integration code.
- Change: redesign of GetInfoFor* API family.
- Change: more documentation on modding/addons/integrations.

# 0.6.3

- Change: internal cleanup of infinite recursion guards. It is now possible for
  upgrades to trigger each other, without causing infinite loops.
- Change: elemental effects will now trigger on AoE upgrades like HE Shots and
  Fragmentation.
- Change: new information about mod compatibility added to README.
- Change: Piercing can now have multiple levels; each level adds another enemy
  it can pierce through.
- Fix: Fragmentation Shots on an AoE weapon like the RL released fragments once
  for every enemy caught in the blast. It now releases fragments only once per
  shot. This is a big nerf to Fragmentation+Piercing, but Piercing is already
  way more powerful than it looks anyways.

# 0.6.2

- New: Explosive Death upgrade causes slain enemies to detonate.
- Change: Acid tree rework
  - Explosive Reaction removed
  - Acid Spray upgraded to mastery; splash radius doubled

# 0.6.0

- New: Fragmentation upgrade for projectile weapons

  - Corrosive Shots adds a weak dot that gets more powerful as the target takes damage;
    it works best with slow-firing, high-damage weapons like the rockets and SSG
  - Acid Spray causes surplus acid to splash onto nearby enemies
  - Embrittlement makes acid stacks increase damage taken by enemies
  - Explosive Reaction turns acid stacks into an explosion on death
- New: weapons are limited to 2 elements, and must master the first before adding the second.
- Change: 2 basic levels are now required to unlock intermediate (and likewise for intermediate->master).
- Change: Documentation tweaks.
- Change: Redesign of damage-over-time API to support fractional stacks/durations.
- Change: Fire now applies stacks based on attack damage.
- Fix: Infinite recursion with some upgrade combinations
- Fix: Weakness upgrade could sometimes give enemies damage resistance.
- WIP: Beam upgrade for hitscan weapons
  - currently disabled due to bad interactions with other weapons

# 0.5.2

- Fix: mod didn't actually load due to some last-minute changes.

  - new Hallucinogens upgrade makes severely poisoned enemies fight on your side
- Change: internal cleanup to UpgradeBag and Dot APIs
- Fix: crash when carrying upgraded weapons across level transitions

# 0.4

- New: Shield, a very powerful defence upgrade for melee weapons only
- New: Dark Harvest, a melee upgrade that restores health and armour on kills
- New: Bouncy Shots, projectiles that bounce off walls and (eventually) enemies

  - Fire DoT now cuts off at 50% of max HP no matter how much damage it's done
  - new Searing Heat upgrade lowers the cutoff point
  - new Conflagration upgrade makes fire spread between enemies
  - new Infernal Kiln upgrade turns burning enemies into a source of damage/defence buffs
  - Pyre upgrade removed
- Fix: DoTs that do fractional damage per tick now work properly
- Fix: rejecting a level-up with ESC would prevent you from ever gaining new upgrades

# 0.3.2

- Add upgrade registry so that other mods can easily add their own integrations.
- Damage upgrade split into two versions: per player (+5%) and per weapon (+10%).
  Both versions are now guaranteed to add at least 1 damage/level.
- HE rounds now do damage based on original attack damage. Blast radius increases
  more slowly with levels. Self-damage protection added.

  XP for missing weapons" option was replaced with a tri-state "upgrade binding
  mode". Please check the options menu for details.

# 0.2

- Builtin upgrades that do not require Legendoom
- Leveling up now gives you a choice of three upgrades from that list
- LD is still supported and weapons can have a mix of builtin and LD upgrades

# 0.1alpha7

- Added that upgrade path back in, along with a lot of settings:
- Which weapons can learn new effects
- Which weapons can replace existing effects
- How many effect slots weapons have

- Fixed a crash on level transition

# 0.1alpha3

- Optional Lazy Points integration.
- Fixed a bug where the HUD would draw even when it shouldn't.
- Weapons should now always have info displayed, even if you haven't fired them yet.
- The might also fix the info screen crash for real this time.

# 0.1alpha2

- Turned off some extraneous debug logging.
- Fixed (probably) an occasional crash when closing the info screen.

# 0.1alpha1

Initial release.
